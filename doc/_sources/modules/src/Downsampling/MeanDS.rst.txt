support for mean-downsampling of arrays 

.. function:: proc meanDownsample(const ref a: [?d] ?t, shape: domain(?)): [shape] t throws where d.rank == shape.rank

   
   Downsample an array by taking the mean of groups of
   elements and storing the results in a smaller array.
   
   :arg a: the array to downsample. It's element type must support addition
           and division by an integer.
   :arg shape: the shape of the downsampled array. It must be the same rank
               as ``a`` and each of its dimensions must be smaller than the
               corresponding dimension of ``a``.
   
   :returns: an array of the provided shape, where each element is the mean
             of the corresponding group of elements in ``a``
